# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for xAdmin v2!
This documentation contains information for users and developers of xAdmin, including setup, ingame usage and API documentation for developers.

<aside class="notice">
If you're having issues and need support, please either create a Gmodstore ticket or join my Discord server

# Initial Setup

To install xAdmin, you simply need to extract the zip that you have downloaded from gmodstore and place the <code>xadmin</code> folder (containing the <code>lua</code> folder) to your <code>/garrysmod/addons</code> directory on your server.

Once you restart your server, xAdmin will be installed and should be functional. For the most part, xAdmin works as-is from here, but if you want to make any configuration changes (recommended), you should also follow the steps below.

<aside class="notice">
When you join the server for the first time, you (or the license holder) should already be set to the "Super Admin" group by default
