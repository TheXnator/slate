# Initial Setup

To install xAdmin, you simply need to extract the zip that you have downloaded from gmodstore and place the <code>xadmin</code> folder (containing the <code>lua</code> folder) to your <code>/garrysmod/addons</code> directory on your server.

Once you restart your server, xAdmin will be installed and should be functional. For the most part, xAdmin works as-is from here, but if you want to make any configuration changes (recommended), you should also follow the steps below.
